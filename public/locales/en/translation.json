It also hosts numerous documents related to each project. However, iScope needed to integrate with another program that was not flexible for modifications. Thus, the iScope team had to handle the integration independently. To optimize the process of document management, a tool was developed to download the documents rather than manually downloading them every time a new one is added. This tool also generates an XML file containing data for each document, such as the project name, project ID, and document title."
